<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Nuala Smith and I am from Ireland. I am 26 years old and my dream is to become a web developer. 
  I really enjoy coding and the ability to figure something out in order to get the result you want.
I have just begun my coding journey and I am excited to see where it takes me in the future.</p>

<p>I originally obtained my Bachelor's degree in Analytical Science and I worked in a lab for two years.
   I enjoyed it at first, however, I slowly began to realise that the science industry was not for me.
   I then went on to do a seven day introductory course in Web Development, which I loved- 
   and here I am now beginning my coding journey.</p>

<p>I am excited to become a female coder, as it is very important to add to the female work force in 
  the tech industry. If I continue to practice and dedicate myself, I will be
  very successful some day.
